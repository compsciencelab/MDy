Enable a flat-bottomed cuboid restraint potential.
The atoms to be restrained are given by 'flatbottom-selection' and are 
restrained within the axis-aligned cuboid box with linear extent
specified by 'flatbottom-range'. 

For example, to apply a restraint to the heavy atoms of a ligand
to contain it within a 20A box centred around the geometric centre of
the selection in the reference coordinate set:


flatbottom           on
flatbottom-file      structure.pdb
flatbottom-target    "resname MOL and noh"
flatbottom-range     20 20 20
