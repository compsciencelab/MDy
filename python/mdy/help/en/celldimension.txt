Linear dimensions of the unit cell.

All simulations are in fully-periodic space and the unit cell must be cuboid.

The unit cell dimensions are determined in the following order:
 1 restart file if restarting
 2 extendedsystem
 3 celldimension
 4 PDB CRYST if defined

ACEMD will not attempt to automatically determine the  unit cell dimensions.
